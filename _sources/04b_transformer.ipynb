        "\n",
        "We won't dig into the deep details of how these architectures work here. If you want to learn more about how these models work there are lots of useful resources available including a free huggingface [course](https://huggingface.co/course). If you have a humanities background or interest you may also find the [Bert for Humanists](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists) project useful. \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the reasons we held of jumping straight to transformers is because of a more general concern with making sure we don't see machine learning as a process of optimising a model architecture but rather a process of trying to think about, and potentially improve our data in combination with choosing a model and improving the training process. \n",
        "\n",
        "The other slightly more practical reason we waited is that Transformer models are (in general) quite computationally expensive. If we are able to get sufficiently good performance using less computationally intensive methods then we might prefer to use those. With this said this can be overstated - again here we are not going to be training a model 'from scratch' (more on this shortly) but instead we will be fine-tuning an existing model. We can often do this with a single GPU and still get very good results. \n",

It is focused on helping [\"Build, train and deploy state of the art models powered by the reference open source in natural language\"](https://huggingface.co/). One of the tools developed by Hugging Face is the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library. This library provides implementations of many transformer based models. This already provides us an easier way to access state of the art models without needing to implement and maintain them ourselves, however, one of the real benefits for us it the ability to use transformers in combination with models from the huggingface ['model hub'](huggingface.co/models). \n",

        "We saw in previous notebooks how fine-tuning can be useful to reduce the amount of training data and compute resources  we need to build a useful model. This, arguably, becomes even more important for transformer based models which can be expensive to train. The Hugging Face ['model hub'](huggingface.co/models) gives us access to a huge number of pre-trained models ranging trained for a large number of tasks on a growing number of languages. \n",
