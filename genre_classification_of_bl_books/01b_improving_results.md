# Improving our model

Our model isn't doing terrible, but we may still want to improve the results, especially as we're only asking the model to predict two classes. 

There are various things we could try to improve our model:
- change the type of model we're using
- change hyperparameters for our model 
- collect more labels 
- reconsider the labels we're using 

Before we consider any of these options, we may want to take a closer look at where our model is wrong. We'll do this in the following notebook/section, which focuses on understanding these errors.
