# Using our newly expanded data

We have now explored the errors in our model and used snorkel to augment our training data without having to manually do any more annotating. In the next two notebooks we see if this has helped us get a better performing model. We take two approaches to doing this:

- keeping our existing fastai model and using our new data
- using a transformer model using our new data
