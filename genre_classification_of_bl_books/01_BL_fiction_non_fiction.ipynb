    "Now that we have done some initial exploration of the annotated dataset we'll turn to the process of creating our first model. Since we are taking a pragmatic approach we want to try and get stuck into our problem fairly quickly. Often we learn a lot about our task and data by trying to train a model. This can make it useful to try and train a model fairly early on to sense check our approach. For example, if we are collecting new training data, it makes sense to try and train a model as soon as we have some data to check if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- our model is able to learn anything from the data\n",
    "- our annoations are in a format we can use\n",
    "- there is anything we need to consider when collecting further annotations. \n",

We won't provide a full introduction to the library but will try and explain what we're doing as we're going along. The `fastai` library offers a 'layered API' which includes a high level API that we can use to quickly develop our model. This will allow us to focus on quick development of our model and developing our overall approach as opposed to writing a lot of code. "

    "\n",
    "Arguably one of the most important developments in deep learning over the past decade has been the adoption of transfer learning. Transfer learning has allowed for deep learning approaches to be deployed to much smaller datasets with a reduced compute requirement. This opens up the potential of developing and applying deep learning to a much broader range of tasks. \n",

    "## What is transfer learning?\n",

    "Transfer learning is the process by which we apply a model which has been trained on one task on a new task. The intuition is that the model will have a 'head start' on the new task compared to starting from scratch. Often the pre-training task has much more data than we might have available. We can still take advantage of this by fine-tuning our model on our specific task. As an example we might have a model trained to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. We could potentially fine-tune this model on a smaller dataset of book reviews with sentiment labels. Although there will be differences in the language used, we would probably find a model trained on sentiment analysis on movies will still do better than starting from scratch with a new model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will utilize a particular type of pre-trained model as the starting point; a language model. "

    "A language model can be used as a starting point for many tasks. Language models are models which, in broad terms, learn the probabilities of word occurrence. There are various ways in which language models can be trained but increasingly they are trained in an unsupervised manner i.e. they are trained from unlabeled data. A example of a task a language model be given is to predict the next work in a sentence for example:\n",

To use this we need to pass in our data, the type of model we want to use and optionally some metric(s) to track. We will use `to_fp16()` to train our model using [mixed precission](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html). This allows us to use less memory and train our model a little bit faster. This can be useful if you are working with limited GPU resources. "

    "## Testing on new data 😬\n",
    "\n",
    "We may be quite confident in our predictions based on the above score but it's often a good idea to be skeptical and about your performance metrics on the data we have for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data drift 😅\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential challenge facing us when we want to apply machine learning to a particular collection is data drift. Data drift occurs when distribution of our training data differs from the distribution of the data we are predicting against. Or put in simpler terms the data we predict against doesn't quite look the same as the data our model was trained on. This shift could be subtle or it could be quite drastic. In our particular case we could think about a number of things being particularly important differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Language \n",
    "\n",
    "From the discussion of generating the training data as part of the Zooniverse crowdsourcing task we know that there was a choice available to participants about the language the annotated. This means we can't necessarily assume that the languages which appear in our training data will be distributed in the same way as in the data we predict on. If our model has mainly seen English, French and Dutch, examples in the training data it might do better on those languages. The model may even do okay on German examples because of some language similarities to Dutch, but we would probably not expect it to do well on Russian book titles. We might be happy to only have predictions work well for some languages but we need to be aware of the potential limitations for the model on other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time period\n",
    "\n",
    "The time period covered by our data is both large, and skewed. This means if we randomly sample from the full dataset we will have less examples of book titles from earlier periods. This might mean our model performs less well on book titles from earlier periods. There are various ways we could try and deal with this, and how we try and deal with this possible issue depends on *what* we are trying to achieve. In the Living with Machines case, we mainly care about 19th Century books so if the model sucks at 16th Century book titles we probably don't mind. If we want to use this model to update all catalogue records we definitely need to keep this in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard examples\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit of a meta one but essentially we might want to worry a little bit about whether some book titles are hard to classify as fiction or non-fiction (for our human annotators). Most annotation tools/tasks allow annotators to skip a task if they are unsure. This might result in our training data missing many 'hard' examples. Our model in turn will therefore be trained on 'easier' titles and not on 'harder' examples. When the model is making predictions it may do worse on these 'hard' examples. "
